#BigNerdRanch Android Programming

This repo is a collection of all the android apps mentioned in the book, Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.


Book:  
[Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/)  
Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, and Kristin Marsicano

This is probably the best book out there for learning android programming. As a beginning Android programmer, my goal is to create a repo that contains code examples while following the chapters in the book including my own code implementation of the programming challenges mentioned at the end of almost all the chapters. 

####Repository Structure:
As I worked through the book, I created eight Android apps. I have organized this repo into a directory containing all these 8 Android apps. Each app has a corresponding "challenge" app which has my own code implementations of the challenges mentioned at the end of most chapters. 

* '*master*' is the main branch that has the latest and greatest code merged from every '*chapter*' and '*challenge*' branch created.
* '*Chapter*' branch is created for every chapter in the book that requires programming. There are some apps that span across multiple chapters in the book. But with the way I have organized the repo, code changes at the end of every chapter for a certain app can be found in the *chapter* branch.

## Apps

####Geoquiz
The first app where we explore the fundamentals of Android projects, activities, layout, and explicit intents.
