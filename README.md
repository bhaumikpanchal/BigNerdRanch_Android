# BigNerdRanch Android Programming

This repo is a collection of all the android apps mentioned in the book, Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.


Book:  
[Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/)  
Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart, and Kristin Marsicano

This is probably the best book out there for learning android programming. As a beginning Android programmer, my goal is to create a repo that contains code examples while following the chapters in the book including my own code implementation of the programming challenges mentioned at the end of almost all the chapters. 

### Repository Structure

**App: main app & challenge app**

As I worked through the book, I created eight Android apps, which is the ***main*** app. I have organized this repo into a directory containing all these 8 Android apps. Each app has a corresponding ***challenge*** app which has my own code implementations of the challenges mentioned at the end of most chapters. 

**Branch: master branch & chapter branch**

***master*** is the main branch that has the latest and greatest code merged from every *main* and *challenge* app. ***chapter*** branch is created for every chapter in the book that requires programming. There are some apps that span across multiple chapters in the book. Therefore, to organize the code by chapter, code changes at the end of every chapter can be found in the ***chapter*** branch.

## Apps

### Geoquiz

[main app](https://github.com/bhaumikpanchal/BigNerdRanch_Android/tree/master/GeoQuiz)         | [challenge app](https://github.com/bhaumikpanchal/BigNerdRanch_Android/tree/master/GeoQuizChallenge) |
----------------------|--------------------|  
 
GeoQuiz tests the user's knowledge of geography. The user presses TRUE or FALSE to answer the question on screen, and GeoQuiz provides instant feedback.

**What I learned while building this app:**  
Fundamentals of Android projects, activities, layout, and explicit intents.
